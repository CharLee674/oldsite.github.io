# Technical Work Experience

## Automation Engineering Co-op at the University of British Columbia
Supervised by Dr. Sudip Shekhar, I am currently working on a part-time basis on a project that involves creating browser-based interfaces to modernize test and measurement instrument automation. I previously worked on this project on a full-time basis as an intern from September to December.

The project spun out of issues caused by COVID-19, namely the limited access researchers faced as restrictions prevented them from conducting in-person activities. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use web app that will allow researchers and hobbyists to interface with automated test and measurement equipments and conduct experiments from the comforts of their own homes. 

My current tasks include:
- Onboarding new users and developing back-end processes to improve the user experience
- Server management and set-up
- Writing instrument drivers in Python

My accomplishments in the last 4 months include:
- Installed Raspberry Pis to provide remote access to lab equipment and experiment set-ups
- Implemented device-level connections (Serial, Ethernet, USB, GPIB) in a Linux environment to expose connections to a remote server stack
- Streamlined the installation process by writing Python and Ansible scripts to cut down set-up time to under 10 minutes.
