Front-end development has never been my strong suit coming from a math/physics heavy background (what do you mean I can't just input a formula for the frame?) but here's my attempts at dabbling in it! I initially tried React but ultimately ended up with this Jekyll implementation for my personal website.


# Overview

**Front page**

![](../../../assets/img/bgimage.png)

**This site was built utilizing the following tools:**
- Jekyll with Beautiful Jekyll template
- GitHub Pages
- Markdown text
- GIMP for edited images

**The design choices I made behind this were:**
- Emphasis on ease of set up and update
- Some blogging features
- Limited front-end knowledge required
- Some technical challenge (so NOT Wordpress or Wix)

**Skills I picked up along the way:**
- Basic HTML/CSS and Markdown
- Basic knowledge of web frameworks like React, NodeJS, Jekyll, and Ruby
- Project configuration and set-up (with React and Jekyll + Ruby)

# Some background story...

When I first entered university, one advice I got from senior students, mentors, and PD coordinators was the importance of having a 'personal website' when networking. The supposed rationale is that it is a good way of showcasing your projects and work. So, back in my freshman year, I told myself that I'd definitely create one during the summer, and that it was going to look like some fancy, Javascript dynamic website.

...Then life + impostor syndrome got in the way (I only had admittedly very mediocre projects back then) and I ended up not completing this until very recently. Thankfully, I now have a lot more projects to showcase as well as more concrete experiences to emphasize!

During my first iteration of the personal website, I was too ambitious and tried to build something from scratch using a combination of React and various HTML + CSS templates. I was job hunting in the middle of one of my most stressful terms of university, and I decided to create a website one day using every tool listed in a front-end position. This included `NodeJS` and `React`, all tools I never worked with before. While I had a productive first day setting everything up, fixing the errors proved to be too annoying and I never touched the website again. (Not to mention, GitHub Pages was something I didn't quite understand back then).

Looking back at that experience a year later, I ended up working with Beautiful Jekyll as it relieves me from having to learn dedicated front-end development, and comes with additional benefits like blogging for me to talk about my personal projects (as seen here).
