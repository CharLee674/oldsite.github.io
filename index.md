*Placeholder image until I can get a better headshot...*

My name is **Charles Lee**, a current 3rd year [*Engineering Physics*](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) student at the University of British Columbia. I am passionate about nothing lol I just wanna gradumacate.

My previous experiences include work with embedded systems, robotics, and software automation, and I'm hoping to gain more exposure in quantum computing or machine learning because idk what to put here!

In my (very occasional) free time, I enjoy playing video games :video_game: , cooking/exploring other cuisines, and travelling! I've also recently started dabbling in more creative endeavours like singing (check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/charles-lee-178054525/10000-hours-enph-253-edition)) and digital art.

Here is supposed to be a link to me resume but I am lazy to add so this will be added tomorrow
