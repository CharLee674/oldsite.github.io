Hi there! My name is **Charles Lee**, a current 3rd year [*Engineering Physics*](https://www.engphys.ubc.ca/) student at the University of British Columbia. My degree consists of a lot of math and physics combined with fundamental classes in electrical, mechanical, and some software engineering. I am hoping to apply my diverse background through a career in tech entrepreneurship and innovate to help others.

My previous experiences include work with circuitry, [robotics](_posts/2020-12-28-robot_summer.md), software automation, and electrical test and measurement equipments. I have some experience with web development, software virtualization, and machine learning (I will be taking a project course in ML this term!), and I'm also currently on a [nanosatellite student engineering team](https://www.ubcorbit.com/) that will be launching a CubeSat in Winter 2021!

My **short-term** career goal is to gain exposure to a variety of fields through internships (*currently seeking opportunities in Canada or Taiwan for summer 2021*). I'm open to any electrical, firmware, software, or project management related positions that fit my current qualifications, which you can read more about in my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ac6JAA6wqIa_JsWMXTWUN4yAuLPRaOEF/view?usp=sharing).

In my (very occasional) free time, I enjoy playing video games, cooking/exploring other cuisines, and travelling. I've also recently started dabbling in more creative endeavours like singing (check out my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/charles-lee-178054525/10000-hours-enph-253-edition)) and digital art.
